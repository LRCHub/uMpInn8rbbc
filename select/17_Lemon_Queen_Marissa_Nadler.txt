Walking through the snow
We could hardly see at all
The city was so quiet
The roads were white with salt
I don't think that place is there anymore
They painted our old house blue

Seasons changed the color
And the lemon queen it grew
Taller and taller
Over you

Through the evergreens
The snow kept falling
The waves onto the reefs
Beach rose in the breeze
I don't think that place is there anymore
With the ocean in view

Seasons changed the color
And the lemon queen it grew
Taller and taller
Over you
Taller and taller
Taller and taller
Taller and taller
Over you
Taller and taller
Taller and taller
Taller and taller
Over you

Seasons changed the color
And the lemon queen it grew
Taller and taller
Over you

Seasons changed the color
And the lemon queen it grew
Taller and taller
Over you
