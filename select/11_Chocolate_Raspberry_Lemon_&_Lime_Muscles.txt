I wish that I could keep you in my pocket,
So I could play with you all the time,
Wrap you up in a little blanket,
Chocolate, Raspberry, Lemon and Lime!

Cause you're mine
Your mine
Your mine
Your mine

My dreams are tropical icy cold,
I'll shake you up from the top of the bottle,
Wake you up in the middle of the night,
Wrap my fingers around you from left to right,

Cause you're mine
Your mine
Your mine
Your mine
Cause your mine
Your mine

I wish that I could keep you in my pocket,
So I could play with you all the time,
Wrap you up in a little blanket,
Chocolate, Raspberry, Lemon and Lime!

Cause you're mine
Your mine
Your mine
Your mine
Cause your mine
Your mine
